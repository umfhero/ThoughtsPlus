## 📰 Full Description (500+ characters)
**For: AlternativeTo full description, README, blog posts, Product Hunt description**

```
ThoughtsPlus is a free, open-source note-taking and productivity suite designed for developers, students, and power users who value keyboard-driven workflows and true data ownership.

## What Makes It Different

**Truly Local-First**: Unlike Notion or other cloud apps, ThoughtsPlus has no account creation, no "offline mode" (because there's no online mode by default), and no telemetry. Your notes are just files in a folder you control.

**Instant Quick Capture**: Most apps require you to open the app, wait for the splash screen, create a new page, then type. ThoughtsPlus uses a global hotkey (Ctrl+Shift+N) to create an instant overlay. Significantly faster for brain dumping than any other tool. Press Esc to auto-save and dismiss.

**Nerdbooks - Code Execution**: Write and execute Python/JavaScript directly in your notes. This makes ThoughtsPlus a hybrid between a note-taker and a developer environment - superior to simple code blocks in other apps.

**Built-in NLP Calendar**: Unlike Obsidian which requires plugins, ThoughtsPlus has a built-in smart calendar. Use Ctrl+M to quick add events with natural language like "meeting with John next Tuesday at 3pm".

## Key Features

- 📓 Jupyter-style executable code cells (Python/JS)
- 🔗 Obsidian-like linked notes with graph visualization
- ⚡ Global quick capture hotkey (Ctrl+Shift+N)
- 📅 Smart calendar with NLP quick add
- 🎨 Visual boards and infinite canvas
- 🤖 AI structure generation for note templates
- ⏱️ Focus timer with session history
- 🎨 Deep customization (themes, fonts, colors)

## Perfect For

- Windows users who prefer keyboard-driven workflows
- Developers who want to run code snippets in their notes
- Anyone tired of subscription-based productivity tools
- Privacy-conscious users who want true data ownership

**Platform**: Windows (Microsoft Store + GitHub)
**Price**: Free forever, open source (MIT)
**Data**: Local files with optional OneDrive sync
