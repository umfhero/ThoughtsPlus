## ThoughtsPlus

**The high-velocity, shortcut-first brain dump for Windows.**

ThoughtsPlus is the ultimate **Integrated Thinking Environment (ITE)** built specifically for those who need to move at the speed of light. While other tools get bogged down in complex menus and "plugin-setup tax," ThoughtsPlus delivers a premium, "batteries-included" experience that combines note-taking, calendar management, and live code execution into one stunning interface.

> [!WARNING]
> **Work in Progress**
>
> This is a work in progress application; please be aware of bugs and issues. Please report any problems you encounter to the [Issues](https://github.com/umfhero/ThoughtsPlus/issues) page.

> [!NOTE]
> **A Note from the Developers**
>
> We welcome contributors, suggestions, and feedback. We know this app is not perfect, but we are trying to make it be. Please bear in mind that this project is built by students trying to create a solution to a common problem; we are doing this for free out of love for the community.

## Why ThoughtsPlus?

The modern workspace is fragmented. You shouldn't have to jump between an IDE to test code, a slow web-app for documentation, and a separate tracker for your schedule. ThoughtsPlus was created to bridge this gap, focusing on **zero friction** and **data sovereignty**.

**Zero Friction:** ThoughtsPlus treats your time as a first-class citizen. Most apps require you to find them, wait for a load screen, and navigate menus just to jot down an idea. We eliminate this "momentum killer" with native, instant system integration via global hotkeys. Your workflow should never be interrupted.

**True Ownership:** No cloud, no telemetry, and no accounts. Your data stays on your machine in standard formats, ensuring your privacy is never a product.

**For the lazy Nerds** Built for developers and students who need their notes to do more than just record information. Execute Python and JavaScript directly in your notebooks, link ideas together, and visualise connections in real-time.

---

## Key Features

**Global Quick Capture (Ctrl+Shift+N):** The standout feature of ThoughtsPlus. Summon a sleek overlay over any window (even full-screen games) to dump a thought and hit Esc to save it instantly. You never have to leave your context.

**Nerdbooks (Execution × Connection):** Write notes with executable Python and JavaScript cells. Use @ mentions to link notes together and visualise them in a stunning force-directed Linked Notes Graph.

**Smart Calendar & AI Tasks:** Stop clicking through date pickers. Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to type "Meeting tomorrow at 3pm" and let the app handle the rest with AI-powered event creation (Ctrl+M).

**Visual Boards:** An infinite 2D canvas for brainstorming. Use sticky notes, drawings, and even specialised Calculator notes to map out your next big project.

**Microwave Timer:** A focus timer designed for speed. Just type "2500" for a 25-minute session - no scrolling, no fuss. Access instantly with Ctrl+Enter.

<div align="center">
  <img src="git/newpics/oldapp-v2.png" alt="Calendar Pro - Original Version" width="600" />
  <p><em>Calendar Pro - Built with Python and CustomTkinter</em></p>
</div>

The original Calendar Pro was a Python-based desktop app built with CustomTkinter that experimented with alternative calendar navigation patterns. While the execution was rough, it laid the conceptual groundwork for CalendarPlus.

**What Worked:**

- Vertical month navigation concept that challenged traditional grid layouts
- Local data persistence with JSON storage
- Note management with countdown indicators
- Clean month selection UI that prioritised ease of navigation

**What Didn't Work:**

- Limited scalability with Python/CustomTkinter stack
- Poor performance and responsiveness
- Lack of advanced features (recurring events, analytics, integrations)
- Basic UI that couldn't compete with modern design standards
- No cross-platform optimisation or professional polish
